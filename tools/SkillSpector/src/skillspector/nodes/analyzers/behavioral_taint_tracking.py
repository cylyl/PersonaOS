    Any single ordered pass over the tree — breadth-first (``ast.walk``) or
    source-order (pre-order) — misses flows where a sink and the assignment
    that taints it are visited in the "wrong" relative order for that
    traversal. Pre-order in particular loses flows where the sink sits inside
    a function, method or loop body defined BEFORE the tainted assignment in
    the file: the body is a subtree visited in full before the later sibling
    statement, even though the code only runs when called, after the
    assignment has already executed. There is no fixed traversal order that
    agrees with both "defined before" and "runs after".

    Taint is therefore computed as reachability in the re-assignment graph,
    using a monotone worklist:

    * One pass over every ``Assign`` seeds the tainted set from direct sources
      (source calls and credential subscripts) and records every propagating
      assignment (``b = a``; ``payload = {"k": secret}``) once, keyed by a
      stable id, then indexes it by each name its value reads, as
      ``referenced_name -> [assignment_id, ...]``.
    * The worklist then drains newly tainted names, firing each assignment that
      reads a drained name AT MOST ONCE total: the first time any name it reads
      becomes tainted, its targets are marked and enqueued; later drains of its
      other reading names skip it. Only names not already tainted are enqueued.

    Taint is add-only — an entry is never overwritten or removed — so the set
    can only grow and is bounded by the number of assigned names. The loop
    therefore cannot oscillate and is guaranteed to terminate. Firing an
    assignment a second time is sound to skip: its targets are all tainted
    after the first firing, so a later firing could only re-taint names and
    add nothing. Each name is dequeued once and each propagating assignment
    fires at most once, so the work is linear in the number of assignments
    plus references — not quadratic in the longest chain, nor K×K' for a wide
    ``a, b, ... = source`` statement read by many tainted names.
